# Token Specification Samples

The samples folder has example token specifications that are generated by the TTF.  A Token Specification is generated using the token TemplateDefinition. The TTF Service composes the specification from the artifacts in the TemplateFormula with details in the TemplateDefinition. The service will return the definition if you provide it with the Id of the TokenDefinition and returns a protobuf object that you can serialize to json. These samples are the json serialized specifications.

Note that the specification includes a hash. Since the specification is generated, it is a snapshot of all the artifact versions it includes. So it is not a static specification unless it is saved and the hash is used to identify it.
