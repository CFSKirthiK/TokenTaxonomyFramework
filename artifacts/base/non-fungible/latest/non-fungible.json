A property title is a good example of a non-fungible token where the value of different real estate titles is not equal and freely exchanging them is a bad idea. Some Non-fungible tokens will need to be represented with their own class, meaning it will share no common properties with other tokens from the same template. These are usually referred to as singletons. Other non-fungible tokens can exist within the same class and have some shared property values while also having unique property values between instances.",

The difference between them are the values like property address, plot numbers, etc. These values make the title unique. There are some properties on a class of titles that are the same, like the county or jurisdiction the property is in. For titles that have some shared values and unique values, it may make more sense to define them in the same class.",

Meaning there would be only a single piece of art represented by the token class. If the art cannot be sub-divided, meaning there can be no fractional owners, this token class can be a singleton if the quantity in the class is set to 1. A singleton has only one instance in the class, essentially meaning the class is the instance, and not be sub-dividable and no new tokens can be minted in the class.",
