      "businessDescription": "Hybrid tokens allow you to create a hierarchy of tokens starting with a parent token being fungible or non-fungible. This parent can then have child tokens of fungible, non-fungible or even hybrid classes. This allows complex tokens like an event ticket with general admission as well as reserved seating or pooling unique assets as tokens and allowing for fractional ownership of the pool, like a mortgaged backed security. Note, this artifact is used to define a hybrid token, but not define a hybrid token. Defining a hybrid is done when composing a token template.",
